**Operators in C++**

Operators are nothing but symbols that tell the compiler to perform some
specific operations. Operators are of the following types -

**1. Arithmetic Operators
        Arithmetic operators perform some arithmetic operation on one or two
        operands. Operators that operate on one operand are called unary
        arithmetic operators and operators that operate on two operands are
        called binary arithmetic operators.
        +,-,*,/,% are binary operators.
        ++, -- are unary operators.


**Pre-incrementer : It increments the value of the operand instantly.

**Post-incrementer : It stores the current value of the operand temporarily
and only after that statement is completed, the value of the operand is
incremented.

**Pre-decrementer : It decrements the value of the operand instantly.

**Post-decrementer : It stores the current value of the operand temporarily
and only after that statement is completed, the value of the operand is
decremented.



**2.Relational Operators
Relational operators define the relation between 2 entities.
They give a boolean value as result i.e true or false.



**3.Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to connect multiple expressions or conditions
together. (&& , ||, !)

        If we need to check whether a number is divisible by both 2 and 3, we will
        use AND operator
        (num%2==0) && num(num%3==0)
        If this expression gives true value then that means that num is divisible by
        both 2 and 3.
        (num%2==0) || (num%3==0)
        If this expression gives true value then that means that num is divisible by
        2 or 3 or both.



**4. Bitwise Operators

        Bitwise operators are the operators that operate on bits and perform bit-
        by-bit operations.
