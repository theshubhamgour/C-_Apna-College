A loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a particular
condition is satisfied.

            The syntax of the for loop is:
                                for (initialization; condition; update) {
                                      // body of-loop
                                }

            The syntax for while loop is
                                    while (condition) {
                                    // body of the loop
                                }
