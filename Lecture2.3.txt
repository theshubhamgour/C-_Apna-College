***Decision making***

**if/else
The if block is used to specify the code to be executed if the condition specified
in if is true, the else block is executed otherwise. however else loop is optional.

**else if
To specify multiple if conditions, we first use if and then the consecutive
statements use else if.

**nested if**
To specify conditions within conditions we make the use of nested ifs
