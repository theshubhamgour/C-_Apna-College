// Hello world program in C++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
 cout << "Hello World!\n";
 return 0;

**In the above program:
        1. Comments
                    The two slash(//) signs are used to add comments in a program. It does
                    not have any effect on the behaviour or outcome of the program. 

        2. #include<iostream>
                    #include is the pre-processor directive that is used to include files in our
                    program. Here we are including the iostream standard file which is
                    necessary for the declarations of basic standard input/output library in
                    C++.

        3. Using namespace std
                    All elements of the standard C++ library are declared within namespace.

        4. int main()
                    The execution of any C++ program starts with the main function, hence it
                    is necessary to have a main function in your program. ‘int’ is the return
                    value of this function. 

        5. {}
                    The curly brackets are used to indicate the starting and ending point of
                    any function. 

        6. cout<<”Hello World!\n”;

                    cout represents the standard output stream in
                    The text between quotations will be printed on the screen.
                    \n will not be printed, it is used to add line break.
                    Each statement in C++ ends with a semicolon (;)

        7. return 0;
                    return signifies the end of a function. We are returning 0 because we
                    mentioned the return type of main function as integer (int main). A zero
                    indicates that everything went fine and a one indicates that something
                    has gone wrong.

***Standard Output (cout)***
         
          By default, the standard output of a program points at the screen. So with the
         cout operator and the “insertion” operator (<<) you can print a message onto
         the screen.

It is possible to use the endl manipulator instead of the new-line character.

**Standard input (cin)**
         
          In most cases the standard input device is the keyboard. With the cin and >>
         operators it is possible to read input from the keyboard.
