***Switch Statement**
        Switch case statements are a substitute for long if statements that compare a
        variable to multiple values.


*The variable in switch should have a constant value.

*x The break statement is optional. It terminates the switch
statement and moves control to the next line after switch.

*x If break statement is not added, switch will not get terminated and
it will continue onto the next line after switch.

*x Every case value should be unique.

*x Default case is optional. But it is important as it is executed when
no case value could be matched.
