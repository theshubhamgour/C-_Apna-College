**Variables**
    A variable is a container (storage area) used to hold data or store information.
    Each variable should be given a unique name (identifier).
    int a=2;
    Here a is the variable name that holds the integer value 2.
    The value of a can be changed, hence the name variable.

    __Rules for defining Variables__
        1. Can only have alphabets, numbers and underscore.
        2. Cannot begin with a number.
        3. Cannot begin with an uppercase character.
        4. Cannot be a keyword defined in C++ language (like int is a keyword).


**Fundamental Data Types in C++ **
        1. int:
                x This data type is used to store integers.
                x It occupies 4 bytes in memory.
                x It can store values from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
                Eg. int age = 18

        2. float and double
                x Used to store floating-point numbers (decimals and exponentials)
                x Size of float is 4 bytes and size of double is 8 bytes.
                x Float is used to store upto 7 decimal digits whereas double is used
                to store upto 15 decimal digits.
                Eg. float pi = 3.14
                double distance = 24E8 // 24 x 108
        3. char
                x This data type is used to store characters.
                x It occupies 1 byte in memory.
                x Characters in C++ are enclosed inside single quotes
                x ASCII code is used to store characters in memory.
                Eg͘ char ch с ͚= 'a'
        4. bool
                x This data type has only 2 values _ true and false.
                x It occupies 1 byte in memory.
                x True is represented as 1 and false as 0.
                Eg. bool flag = false
                
**Derived Data Types**
        These are the data types that are derived from fundamental (or built-in) data
        types. For example, arrays, pointers, function, reference.

**User-Defined Data Types**
        These are the data types that are defined by user itself.
        For example, class, structure, union, enumeration, etc
