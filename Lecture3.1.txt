***Jumps in Loops ***
There are two statements
used to implement jump in loops - Continue and Break

__1. Continue
            Continue statement is used to skip to the next iteration of that loop. This
            means that it stops one iteration of the loop. All the statements present
            after the continue statement in that loop are not executed

___2. Break
            Break statement is used to terminate the current loop. As soon as the break
            statement is encountered in a loop, all further iterations of the loop are
            stopped and control is shifted to the first statement after the end of loop
