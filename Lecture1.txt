    **Introduction to Programming Languages **

        A program is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do in order to come up with
        a solution to a particular problem. Programs are written using a programming language. In nutshell Programs are set of instructions.

    **Compiler vs Interpreter**

        Compiler:
                    A compiler is a computer program that translates a program written in a high-level language
        to the machine language of a computer.
        The high-level program is referred to as 'the source code.' The compiler is used to translate
        source code into machine code or compiled code.

        Interpreter:
                        An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in
        a programming language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into
        a machine language program. 

    **Intoduction to C++ Programming language**

            C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
            It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language

            Why Use C++?
            1. C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
            2. C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and
            embedded systems.
            3. C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to
            programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
            4. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to
            multiple platforms.
